    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
       
          <p>Aldous Huxley (July 26, 1894- November 22, 1963), English novelist and critic gifted with an acute and far-ranging intelligence whose works are notable for their wit and pessimistic satire.</p>
        
         <p>He remains best known for one novel, "Brave New World" (1932), a model for much dystopian science fiction that followed.</p>

         <p>Huxley was educated at Eton, during which he became partially blind because of Keratitis. He retained enough eyesight to read with difficulty, and he graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1916.
         </p>

         <p> Huxley published his first book in 1916 and worked on the periodical "Athenaeum" from 1919 to 1921. Thereafter he devoted himself largely to his own writing and spent much of his time in Italy until the late 1930s, when he settled in California.</p>

         <p>Huxley's book "Brave New World" (1932) marked a turning point in Huxley`s career: like his earlier work, it is a fundamentally satiric novel, but it also vividly expresses Huxley`s distrust of 20th-century trends in both politics and technology. The novel presents a nightmarish vision of a future society in which psychological conditioning forms the basis for a scientifically determined and immutable caste system that, in turn, obliterates the individual and grants all control to the World State.</p>

        <p>The author`s lifelong preoccupation with the negative and positive impacts of science and technology on 20th-century life make him one of the representative writers and intellectuals of that century.</p>
